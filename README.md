# Graphic-Recorder
This was a final project for a class utilizing LabVIEW 2019.

It's a program that allows a user to record stereo/mono audio using a mic plugged into their headphone jack. 
This project was done on macOS Mojave 10.14.6.
User's that want to run this program on their computer must give the application permission to the device's microphone.
User's have the ability to choose the sample rate of the recording, the bits per sample, and the recordings destination. 
The program displays several pieces of data such as an FFT spectrum and a waveform graph while displaying different magnitudes of each frequency. 

Feel free to download and run this program.
